# Adventure_Works_Dashboard_BI-
In this project, I have used Power BI to connect, transform and analyze data, to build relational models to blend data and define complex calculations using DAX. At last to visualize data with interactive reports and dashboards.

*Executive Summary*

In this dashboard, the summary of all the total orders by category and subcategory is given for a specified timeline. It shows us the overall monthly revenue & returns and the top product in terms of order and profit.To view a particular product we can just drillthrough to product detail to gain the insight.

*Product Detail*
--

In this dashboard, we can see the details of the selected product which we had drillthrough from Executive Summary. It gives us the monthly target (kept at 10% increase from last month) VS the selected product orders and revenue of the month. It also paints us a weekly profit and an estimated profit when the prioce is adjusted by different percent.
